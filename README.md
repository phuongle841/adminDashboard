- How to set bigger home button but still align with the lower button
  - in the sidebar set grid 1f 3fr\*3 (gap 80px)
  - functions and settings set grid 1fr for all functions and setting functions.
  - each row is a div of 1 img and 1 p
  - this div is grid 1fr 2fr and align-items center (gap 10px)
  - the homeButton img width fit content
  - the functions and settings img justify-self end.
  - when input is setting hover in css file, the label is also considered as part of input, but it's just effect input, not label, so label still have to have hover effect of its own.
